Install the matplotlib dependency. On linux this is usually something like:
```
pip3 install matplotlib
```

Run the code:
```
python3 main.py
```

To make r_naught constant instead of C, run with `python3 main.py -r`

Displays a graph and saves it to `weed_spread_c.png` or `weed_spread_r.png` depending on which variable is constant.
